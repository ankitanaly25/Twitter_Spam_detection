# Twitter_Spam_detection
Twitter Spam Detection

A machine learning project to classify tweets as spam or genuine using text preprocessing and classification models.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy

NLTK (text preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

📌 Workflow

Data cleaning (removed null/unused columns)

Text preprocessing (punctuation removal, tokenization, stopwords)

Feature extraction (Bag-of-Words)

Model training & evaluation

🚀 Run
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-spam-detection.git
cd twitter-spam-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook "Twitter spam detection.ipynb"

✨ Future Scope

Use deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers)

Deploy with Flask/Streamlit
